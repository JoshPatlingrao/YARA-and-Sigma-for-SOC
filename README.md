## Intro
### Notes
- YARA and Sigma are critical tools for SOC analysts (Security Operations Center).
- They enhance threat detection and incident response capabilities.

Key Benefits
- Improved threat detection
- Efficient log analysis
- Malware detection and classification
- IOC identification
- Collaboration and rule sharing
- Customization and integration with other security tools

YARA vs. Sigma
- YARA:
  - Best suited for file and memory analysis
  - Great at pattern matching
- Sigma:
  - Tailored for log analysis
  - Works well with SIEM systems
 
How it Works
- Use detection rules based on conditional logic:
  - Applied to logs (Sigma) or files/memory (YARA)
  - Detects suspicious activities or known patterns

Standardization & Community Use
- Both follow standard rule formats
- Designed to facilitate rule creation and sharing across the cybersecurity community

Importance of YARA and Sigma Rules
- Enhanced Threat Detection
  - Custom detection rules allow SOC analysts to identify patterns, behaviors, or indicators linked to threats.
  - Analysts can proactively detect and respond to incidents.
  - YARA Rule Rources:
    - YARA Malware Rules – Yara-Rules (https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules/tree/master/malware)
    - Open-Source YARA Rules – MikeSxrs (https://github.com/mikesxrs/Open-Source-YARA-rules/tree/master)
  - Sigma Rule Sources:
    - Sigma Rules – SigmaHQ (https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/tree/master/rules)
    - Joe Security Sigma Rules (https://github.com/joesecurity/sigma-rules)
    - SIGMA Detection Rules – mdecrevoisier (https://github.com/mdecrevoisier/SIGMA-detection-rules)
- Efficient Log Analysis
  - Sigma rules are designed for filtering and correlating logs from various sources.
  - Reduces noise and highlights security-relevant events.
  - Supports faster, focused investigations.
  - Tool Example: Chainsaw (https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/chainsaw) — applies Sigma rules to Windows Event Logs.
- Collaboration and Standardization
  - YARA and Sigma use standardized formats, making rule sharing and collaboration easier.
  - Helps the community develop and share best practices and threat intelligence.
  - Shared rule examples:
    - DFIR YARA Rules (https://github.com/The-DFIR-Report/Yara-Rules)
    - DFIR Sigma Rules (https://github.com/The-DFIR-Report/Sigma-Rules)
- Integration with Security Tools
  - Compatible with SIEMs, EDRs, log analysis tools, and IR platforms.
  - Allows for automation and enrichment of alerts.
  - Tool Example: Uncoder.io (https://uncoder.io/) — converts Sigma rules into SIEM/XDR-ready queries.
- Malware Detection and Classification
  - YARA rules can be used to define malware signatures and detect specific traits or behaviors.
  - Aids in classifying and mitigating malware quickly.
- IOC Identification
  - Both rule types help detect IOCs (e.g., IPs, hashes, domains, filenames).
  - Helps quickly respond to threats and limit attacker dwell time.

## YARA and Rules
### Notes


Overview
- **What is YARA?**
  - A pattern-matching tool and rule format used to identify and classify files based on specific content or characteristics.
- **Primary Use Cases**
  - Detection and classification of malware.
    - Identify malware samples using signatures, behaviors, or file properties.
    - Useful in detecting malicious files and analyzing memory dumps in forensic investigations.
  - Analysis and identification of suspicious files.
    - Categorize files based on attributes such as: file type, format, version, metadata, packers, or other identifiers
    - Especially helpful in malware research and large-scale forensic investigations.
  - Spotting IOCs.
    - Detect known IOCs such as: filenames, registry keys and network indicators
    - Facilitates identification of breaches or ongoing attacks.
  - Memory forensics and threat hunting.
    - Conduct environment-wide scans for: hidden threats or remnants of previous infections
    - Reduces reliance on reactive alerts.
  - Community-Driven Rule Sharing
    - Leverage shared YARA rule sets from the global cybersecurity community.
    - Helps maintain up-to-date detection capabilities.
  - Create Custom Security Solutions
    - Combine YARA rules with: static/dynamic analysis, sandboxing and behavior monitoring
    - Builds stronger, layered detection mechanisms.
  - Custom YARA Rules/Signatures
    - Tailor detection rules for specific organizational needs.
    - Deploy within tools like antivirus or EDR solutions.
    - Detect targeted threats unique to your infrastructure or industry.
  - Incident Response
    - Quickly search memory or files for relevant artifacts during investigations.
    - Helps define the scope and impact of incidents.
- **YARA Rules**
  - Written in a specific syntax.
  - Can include: strings, regular expressions and Boolean logic
  - Supports both textual and binary pattern matching.
- **Application Method**
  - Scans files or directories to match defined patterns.
  - Triggers alerts when conditions are met.
  - Can be integrated into automated security workflows.
- **Key Benefits for SOC Analysts**
  - Enables precise and complex detections.
  - Ideal for malware analysis and forensic investigations.
  - Highly flexible and widely supported in the cybersecurity community.

How Yara Works
- Set of YARA Rules
  - Created by security analysts.
  - Define suspicious patterns or indicators such as: strings, byte sequences and regular expressions
  - Stored in .yar or .yara files for reusability.
- Set of Files for Scanning
  - Input files can be: executables, documents, scripts, memory images or captured network traffic
  - Files are scanned to detect matches with rule-defined patterns.
- YARA Scan Engine
  - Core engine that performs the matching process.
  - Uses YARA modules — internal components that enhance detection through efficient scanning techniques.
- Scanning and Matching Process
  - Engine scans each file byte-by-byte.
  - Applies string matching, regex matching, and binary pattern matching.
  - Compares file contents against the rules for matches.
- Detection of Matches
  - If a file matches a rule’s conditions, it is marked as detected.
  - The engine logs details like: matched rule name, file path and offset (location) of the match within the file
  - Results can be used for alerts, further analysis, or incident response.
